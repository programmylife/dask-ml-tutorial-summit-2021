[Dask-ML](https://ml.dask.org) provides scalable machine learning in Python
using Dask alongside popular machine learning libraries like Scikit-Learn,
XGBoost, and others.

We generally consider two primary challenges when scaling machine learning code,
scaling model size and data size. `dask-ml` offers ways to address each.
